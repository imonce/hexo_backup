An evaluation index system refers to an organic whole with an internal structure composed of multiple indicators that characterize various aspects of the evaluation object and their interconnections.

# Principles to be followed

In order to make the indicator system scientific and standardized, the following principles should be followed when constructing it:

1. **Systematic principle.** There should be a certain logical relationship between the indicators. They should not only reflect the main characteristics and states of the ecological, economic and social subsystems from different aspects, but also reflect the internal relationship between the ecological, economic and social systems. Each subsystem is composed of a set of indicators, which are independent of each other and connected with each other to form an organic unity. The construction of the index system is hierarchical, from the top to the bottom, from the macro level to the micro level, forming an indivisible evaluation system.
2. **Typical principle.** It is necessary to ensure that the evaluation indicators have certain typical representativeness, and reflect the comprehensive characteristics of the environment, economy and social changes in a specific region as accurately as possible. Even if the number of indicators is reduced, it is also necessary to facilitate data calculation and improve the reliability of the results. In addition, the setting of evaluation index system, the distribution of weight among indexes and the division of evaluation standard should be adapted to the natural and socio-economic conditions of a specific region.
3. **Dynamic principle.** The interactive development of ecology, economy and social benefits can only be reflected through certain time scale indicators. Therefore, dynamic changes should be fully considered in the selection of indicators, and the change values of several years should be collected.
4. **Concise and scientific principle.** The design of each index system and the selection of evaluation indexes must be based on the principle of scientificity, which can objectively and truly reflect the characteristics and conditions of Gaoxigou's environmental, economic and social development, and can objectively and comprehensively reflect the real relationship between each index. Each evaluation index should be typical, not too many and too detailed, so that the index is too cumbersome and overlapping, and the index cannot be too few and too simple, so as to avoid the omission of index information, errors and untrue phenomena, and the data is easy to obtain and the calculation method is simple and easy to understand.
5. **Comparable, operable and quantifiable principle.** In terms of indicator selection, special attention should be paid to the consistency within the overall scope. The construction of indicator system serves for the formulation of field assessment and scientific management. The calculation measures and calculation methods of indicator selection must be consistent and unified. Each indicator should be as simple and clear as possible, micro and easy to collect. Each indicator should be highly practical, operable and comparable. In addition, when selecting indicators, it is also necessary to consider whether quantitative processing can be carried out to facilitate mathematical calculation and analysis.
6. **Comprehensive principle.** At the corresponding evaluation level, the factors affecting the environment, economy and social system are comprehensively considered, and comprehensive analysis and evaluation are carried out.

# Features that should be possessed

And the constructed index system should possess these features:

1. Perform a clear guidance direction
2. Quantitative based and qualitative supplemented
3. Difference classification considered

# General construction process

1. Building the theoretical foundation
2. Provide empirical evidence
   1. Statistical data support
   2. Evidence from typical cases
   3. Reasonable interpretation of contradictory cases
3. Verify operability

# Representative evaluation system: 3E

3E theory refers to:

- Efficacy, which measures its own output
- Efficiency, which reflects the utilization of resources
- Effectiveness, which reflects the effect of the system output on its superior system

3E system represents the trend of diversified development of performance evaluation system. Through the establishment of 3E standard system, the soft environment evaluation system is more scientific and transparent, and the efficiency and operability of performance evaluation are increased, which greatly promotes the improvement and development of public policy evaluation system.
