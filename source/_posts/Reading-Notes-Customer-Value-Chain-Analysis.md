# overall

Customer Value Chain Analysis (CVCA) is an original methodological tool that enables design teams in the product definition phase to comprehensively identify pertinent stakeholders, their relationships with each other, and their role in the product’s life cycle.

# method

1. CVCA Step 1: Determine the business model for the vending machine.
2. CVCA Step 2: Delineate pertinent parties involved with the vending machine’s life cycle.
3. CVCA Step 3: Determine how the vending machine’s customers are related to each other.
4. CVCA Step 4: Identify the value propositions of the vending machine’s customers and define the flows between them.
5. CVCA Step 5: Analyze the Customer Chain to determine the vending machine’s critical customers and their value propositions. The vending operator and the soft drink bottler (circled) were determined to be the critical customers to the vending machine manufacturer.
