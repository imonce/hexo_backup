# 时间序列分类（TSC）问题定义

**Definition 1** A univariate time series $X = [x_1, x_2, . . . , x_T ]$ is an ordered set of real values. The length of X is equal to the number of real values T.

Definition 2 An M -dimensional MTS, X = [X1, X2, . . . , XM ] consists of M different univariate
time series with Xi ∈ RT .

Definition 3 A dataset D = {(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . . , (XN , YN )} is a collection of pairs (Xi, Yi)
where Xi could either be a univariate or multivariate time series with Yi as its corresponding one-
hot label vector. For a dataset containing K classes, the one-hot label vector Yi is a vector of length
K where each element j ∈ [1, K] is equal to 1 if the class of Xi is j and 0 otherwise.
